A musical fountain, also known as a dancing fountain, is a type of animated fountain for entertainment purposes \n

light, and in doing so, three-dimensional images can be produced. \n
Installations can be large scale, employing hundreds of water jets and lights, and costing into the millions of \n
dollars, or in smaller household forms, where a budget of one thousand dollars is feasible. Musical features tend to \n
be complex, and require a degree of mechanical, hydraulic, electrical, and electronic components out of view that \n
might be as impressive to its audience as the show itself.
