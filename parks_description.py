    # Arad
    'Tel Arad National Park':
'''
Tel Arad was declared a national park in 1982, covering a declared area of 513 dunams. The national park was \n
approved for expansion to 1,235 dunams, creating a good expanse for preserving natural values on the loess soil.\n(
Approval means that the plan is approved in all respects under the Planning and Construction Law, but because the \n
declaration is not yet official, the National Parks Law does not apply to the expansion at this time.)

    'Masada National Park':
'''
In the fifth century CE, Masada was settled by monks, who established a lavritic (hermetic) monastery. Some people \n
have identified the monastery on Masada with the Marda monastery mentioned in the literature of the Church Fathers. \n
This settlement appears to have ceased to exist with the rise of Islam in the seventh century CE.

    'Children Park':
'''
We were travelling by road across Israel and this was the best pit stop we made. The kids (aged 2-14yrs) all loved \n
spending an hour playing here. There was something for everyone. Two playgrounds cater for all ages and it is \n
extremely clean and well cared for. Highly recommend this as a pit stop for families travelling by road in this area.

    'Pura Nature Reserve':
'''
Some hikes are good for all seasons.  And others are really perfect for one specific time of year. \n
Take Pura Nature Reserve, for example.  This hike is in one of Israel’s National Parks.  It’s on the National Parks \n
website, and it’s only about an hour away – but we had never been there before.  That’s probably because Pura looks \n
very different in the wintertime than it does at any other time of year. And when were we ever looking for a hike in \n
the wintertime?? \n
Pura Nature Reserve is South of Jerusalem, not far from the Ruhama Badlands. And during winter blossoming season, \n
there’s the most amazing display of colorful flowers spattered throughout green rolling hills.

    'Timna Park':
'''
Timna Park is located about 25 km (about 17 miles) north of Eilat in Israel’s Negev Desert. One of the largest \n
attractions in the south of Israel the park sits in a beautifully majestic desert setting. It has amazing history and \n
geology. There are also a number of unexpected activities including those on the lake (yes, a lake in the desert!). \n
It covers about 15,000 acres in a horseshoe-shaped valley surrounded by steep cliffs, with Mount Timna, the world’s \n
first ever copper mine, standing tall in the center. Daily tours to Timna Park are available from Eilat.

    'Underwater Observatory Marine Park':
'''
Established in 1975, the Underwater Observatory Eilat was built so that visitors could explore the wonders of the \n
Red Sea in a new and exciting way. \n
Our founders, the Kahn family, who spent many diving trips in Eilat, had a vision of a revolutionary kind of aquarium \n
- an underwater observatory where visitors can enjoy up-close encounters with coral reefs, without getting wet. As \n
the first land-based, underwater tourist attraction, we enjoyed immediate success. \n
Initially they constructed the unique Underwater Observatory Tower, which today consists of two adjoining towers, \n
the first erected in 1974 and the second larger one, in 1991. \n
With no nets around the towers to keep the fish and marine creatures close by, all our marine life come and live by \n
the reef voluntarily, a testament to how our staff maintain the Israel coral reef and treat marine life with the \n
utmost respect.

    'Red Canyon':
'''The Red Canyon in the Eilat Mountains is one of Israel’s most beautiful yet accessible hiking trails. Entrance to \n
the park is completely free. Twenty minutes north of Eilat, this stunning geological wonder offers an undisturbed \n
hike through the natural canyons. The Red Canyon gets its name from the phenomenon which occurs when sunlight hits \n
the reddish rock that lines the canyon. It then glows with an intense reddish color. The rock is varied in color and \n
in patches is shades of white and yellow. The colors come from the sandstone that’s been carved by wind and water \n
through the ages.

    # Haifa
    'Carmel National Park':
'''
Carmel Hay-Bar nature reserve: A nature reserve for breeding animals in danger of extinction or which have become \n
extinct in the area, and returning them into the wild. The Hay-Bar maintains breeding cells of Persian fallow deer \n
(Dama mesopotamica) and roe deer (capreolus capreolus), vultures and other raptors. The nature reserve is open to \n
visitors on Saturdays and holidays, and to groups on other days, by advance reservation. \n
Horshat HaArbaim: A 1.5 km circular trail. On the way it passes by ancient oak trees and lookout points with a vista \n

    'Nesher Park':
'''
This is not an actual observation point, but the two hanging bridges in Nesher Park that span the deep channel of \n
Nahal Katia, provide a rare view of the slope beneath the University of Haifa, which is entirely covered by a \n
natural, well-developed forest. \n
To walk on the slightly swaying bridges, which are about 70 meters in length, is an experience. There is also a \n
walking path that crosses the river on one bridge and returns via the other bridge. The first bridge can be reached \n
by an easy, unpaved path along the northern bank of the stream; this is a 10 minute walk. One can also actually cross \n
the river bed itself and walk to the bridge on the slope of the southern bank, in the heart of nature. This path \n
offers forest foliage as well as views of the stream and the green slopes of the Carmel, and takes about a half hour.

    'Hecht Park':
'''
Head north from the gas station and parking lot to reach Hecht Park. The park was established with funds from the \n
Hecht Foundation and designed by the landscape architects Greenstein-Har-Gil. It is comprised of lawns, which are the \n
most expansive in Haifa, along with typical Mediterranean vegetation, a promenade, playground and benches. Walk north \n
for approximately a kilometer and shortly after another gas station beside the park pass underneath the rail tracks \n
and head in the direction of the sea. This part, which hugs the coast, is the Shikmona Nature Reserve, the loveliest \n
part of Haifa’s coastline. This stretch of the coast was declared a nature reserve in 2008 partly due to its unique \n
reef made up of a kind of gastropod that acts as a habitat for sea creatures and is unique to the eastern \n
Mediterranean. Plant species, some of which are rare, grow on the coast, such as the evening primrose, which blooms \n
just before sunset, and the limonium that covers the coastline in a carpet of purple in the spring. Tel Shikmona, \n
one of the most interesting archaeological sites in Israel, is situated in the northern part of the nature reserve. \n
Settled during the 15th century BCE, the site consists of ruins and a mosaic floor. Findings from the site are on \n
display in the National Maritime Museum located a little further north.

    # Jerusalem
    'Tayelet Haas Promenade':
'''
The Haas Promenade is one of the best places to start a tour of Jerusalem. This panoramic viewpoint offers a \n
sweeping view of the city and, in true Jerusalem fashion, is itself replete with thousands of years of history. \n
The promenade – popularly known in Hebrew as "the Tayelet" – actually comprises several walkways: the Walter and \n
Elise Haas Promenade, the Richard and Rhoda Goldman Promenade and the Gabriel Sherover Promenade. From the heights of \n

    'Liberty Bell Park':
'''
Liberty Bell Park is a park in Jerusalem containing a replica of the Liberty Bell from which it gets its name. It \n
is located near the Talbiyeh, German Colony, and Yemin Moshe neighborhoods. Founded in 1976 to celebrate the USA's \n
bicentennial and covering 9 acres, it is the most popular park in the city. It includes sports facilities, \n
a picnic area, a 1,000-seat amphitheater, a music corner and areas for exhibitions, folk dancing and performances.\n
The park features Jerry the Dragon, a concrete play sculpture by Ulrik Plesner, the Danish-born Israeli architect who \n
designed the park.\n
The Train Theater, a children's puppet theater, is housed in an old railway carriage at the northern end of Liberty \n
Bell Park.

    'Gan Sacher Park':
'''
The largest stretch of picnic greenery in Jerusalem, Gan Sacher (or Sacher Park) (pronounced Sah-kehr) is situated \n
between the Nachlaot and Rehavia neighborhoods on one side, and the complex of government buildings and museums in \n
Givat Ram, Gan Sacher is the largest green space in Jerusalem. \n
The expanse of grass is large enough that it only gets crowded during a concert, or when thousands of Israeli \n
revelers converge on the park en masses for the annual Independence Day grill fest. The trees on the edges of the \n
grass provide sufficient shade for a sprawling picnic spread, while the un-shaded areas are large enough to support a \n
game of ultimate Frisbee. \n
More activity-specific facilities include basketball courts, soccer pitches, tennis courts, a bike path (which \n
extends for several kilometers beyond the park), a large children’s playground, an exercise park, and the Bird \n
Observatory. It’s also a short walking distance to the Israel Museum and Bible Lands Museum. Definitely a place to go \n
in good weather. 
''',

    'Bloomfield Garden':
'''
The Bloomfield Garden, located just above and on either side of the Yemin Moshe neighborhood, is one of the largest \n
parks in Jerusalem (approximately 17 acres). The municipality purchased the Nikephoria area in which the park is \n
located from the Greek Orthodox Church in order to safeguard its preservation as public open space. The park’s design \n
by Ulrik Plessner was intended to be an organic extension of the open spaces surrounding the Old City to the east. \n
The garden incorporates the family tomb of King Herod and remains of an ancient aqueduct. The park includes lawns, \n
play areas and a fountain. Benches, drinking fountains (including Gwendoline’s Fountain for dogs), bathrooms and \n
flower beds have been added over the years. In 1996, the garden was renovated and the Israel Bonds Tribute Site, \n
which includes a time capsule, was created at the park.

    'Rabinovich Park':
'''
The Rabinovitch Park is located at a prominent intersection in Kiryat Hayovel. The park’s central feature is The \n
Golem, a monumental play sculpture by French-American artist Niki de St. Phalle (1930-2002). The vividly painted, \n
two-story monster head with tongue slides is a Jerusalem landmark, known simply as The Monster. Children climb up an \n
exterior stairway, enter a small dark room, then slide down through the monster’s gaping mouth. Dr. Martin Weyl, \n
former director of the Israel Museum and former art advisor to mayor Teddy Kollek recalls that the mayor was to have \n
inaugurated the sculpture by sliding down one of the tongues, but he couldn’t get up the ladder because of the crush \n
of children. In an interview held in connection with an exhibit of St. Phalle’s at the Pompidou Center in Paris in \n
1980, the artist stated that the sculpture was the work of which is she was most proud.

    # Ramat Gan
    'Ramat Gan National Park':
'''
Ramat Gan National Park is a large urban park in the Tel Aviv District city of Ramat Gan, Israel. It is not \n
actually a national park. The initiator of the idea of setting up the park was the first mayor of Ramat Gan Avraham \n
Krinitzi who actively promoted the idea. Krinitzi advocated for setting it in the southern part of the city. He is \n
also buried there with his wife and driver, who all died in a car accident together on their way back from the city \n
of Acre, where he was also the Mayor at the time. \n
The planting began in February 1951 and the park opened to the public in 1953. In 1959, an artificial lake was \n
created, which was enlarged throughout the years. \n
The park covers an area of 1.9 km2. It is the second largest urban park in Israel, after the Yarkon Park. The park \n
attracts 700-800 thousand visitors annually. The Ramat Gan Safari is adjacent to the park. Recently, a waterfall \n
was added to the park as an expansion to the lake.

    # Tel Aviv
    'Jaffa Slope Park':
'''
The Jaffa Slope Park borders the Ajami neighborhood of Jaffa and spreads over 50 acres of luscious, green, \n
rolling hills. It is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful parks in the area and stretches from the Jaffa Port in the \n
north to the Aliyah Hill in the south. \n
For years the site was used as a dump yard for construction waste and was an environmental hazard as well as a center \n
for criminal activity. Then, in 2010, the park was opened after extensive renovation and since then has become a \n
popular and busy leisure site. The promenade running alongside the park serves as a wharf for fishermen, a path for \n
walkers, bike-riders and those wishing to sit on the benches and just take in the lovely view. The park is also a \n
great place for a barbecue and for those with children who can enjoy the facilities offered on site.

    'Park Darom':
'''
Some people lament the fact that The Yarkon Park which runs along the tiny Yarkon River is the only real Park in \n
Tel Aviv.  Yes, Park HaYarkon is large and sprawling, yes it's great for cycling, and I definitely do enjoy all of \n
the attractions there - but it just doesn't keep out the city like the great city parks do. You still hear the \n
traffic, see the tall buildings tower over most of the trees and you definitely feel the "dinkiness" of it. Plus, \n
its SO far from so much of the city! \n
Most visitors write this off to the fact that the city's entire western border of Tel Aviv is the beach- a public \n
park in and of itself, making it unnecessary to ensure that the Yarkon Park is something truly spectacular. But what \n
most people, even Tel Aviv residents, don't know is that there is another a large, grassy Tel Aviv park that is \n
super-awesome- it's just not smack dab in the center. \n
This is Park Darom and it is one of the hidden gems of Tel Aviv. The park is extremely well kempt, with the grass \n
always mowed and watered, and the paths always safe and clean. In fact, the park even has its own website that you \n
can check out here which showcases all of the activities, attractions and great things about the park. Don't worry, \n
since the site is all in Hebrew I won't leave you hanging.

    'Edith Wolfson Park':
'''
Located on top of a hill, the park sits on the border between Tel Aviv and Givatayim. The park was established \n
thanks to the generous donation of Edith Wolfson, the late wife of the late Sir Isaac Wolfson, British philanthropist \n
and businessman. The park is topped by the White Square, an environmental sculpture site reflecting Tel Aviv’s \n
history and scenery, by the Israeli architect, Dani Karavan. Known as Kikar Levana, the sculpture was donated as a \n
gesture to the Founders of the City of Tel Aviv. 
''',

    'Independence Park':
'''
Independence Park is a large green area in the center of Jerusalem, bounded by King George Street to the West, \n
Agron Street to the south, Hillel Street to the north and the old Mamilla Cemetery to the east. During the time of \n
the British Mandate, the Park was an open area that served as a barrier between the Jewish city center and the \n
upscale Arab neighborhoods to the south. After Jerusalem was partitioned in the 1948 War of Independence, the nascent \n
Israeli government decided that the area would become a green area; thus Independence Park was established in 1959. \n
During the daylight hours, the Park mostly serves the many people who work in the center of town and like to have \n
their lunches outside. Families from around the area come to hang out, picnic and kick a ball around, \n
and young people can often be spotted leisurely sipping beers in the shade of the large pine trees. But like its \n
namesake park in Tel-Aviv, after night falls, under a thick blanket of darkness, Independence Park becomes a \n
rendezvous spot for members of Jerusalem’s gay community. It is this function that has made the Park a convergence \n
point for many LGBT events, including the annual gay pride parade. Other events held at Independence Park include the \n
yearly Student’s Day celebrations when thousands turn out to enjoy live music performances.

    'Arbel National Park':
'''
In the eastern Lower Galilee, on the way to Tiberias, a monumental cliff towers up, offering a breathtaking view of \n
the Jordan Valley, the Sea of Galilee, the Golan Heights, Mt Hermon, and the Galilee. This is the Arbel Cliff, \n
the heart of the Arbel Nature Reserve, declared in 1967, and the national park that surrounds it, which also includes \n
Mt Nitai, Mt Savyon, the Horns of Hittim, and the Arbel Plateau. \n
The main importance of the nature reserve and the reason for its declaration is preservation of the diversity of \n
habitats it contains and the unique species that inhabit it, as well as the fact that it is part of a continuum of \n
natural areas, allowing wildlife to pass between them. In addition, the site was declared a nature reserve in order \n
to restore and conserve the fascinating heritage sites and antiquities found at Arbel. These sites include Arbel \n
Fortress and the impressive cave village, where historic battles were fought in the days of Herod, Horvat Vradim\n
(Hamam), and the ruins of the Jewish settlement of Arbel, in which the remains of a splendid ancient Galilean \n
synagogue are still to be seen.

    'Kfar Nahum National Park':
'''
The synagogue that visitors see today was in use during the Byzantine period. An earlier synagogue also stood \n
here; scholars are divided over whether it was built in the third or the fourth century CE. \n
A very exciting site for Christian pilgrims is one that started out in the first century CE as a dwelling. The floor \n
of one of the rooms was covered with white plaster and its walls were adorned with plaster painted with geometric \n
patterns and colorful flowers. Apparently as early as the first century the building served as a gathering place for \n
the first Christians (Judeo-Christians). Discovered at the site were 173 plaster fragments bearing inscriptions, \n
mostly in Greek. Some, like “our Lord”, “the Nazarene”, “the greatest of all” and “Simon”, attest to the existence of \n
a Christian community. \n
In the fourth century the assembly room in the private dwelling became a small public structure. In the middle of the \n
fifth century the site was leveled and an octagonal church was built on top, with the original room right in the \n
center. A larger octagon was built around the inner one, with a mosaic floor bearing floral decorations. Christian \n
pilgrims of the sixth century mention the church, noting that it was built over the house of the Apostle Peter. A \n
modern church stands over the site today.

gate was built in a form that was common in this period, and is similar to the gates at Gezer and Megiddo. To the \n
south of the gate are the remains of a casemate city wall from the same period (made of two parallel walls with a \n
space between them, divided into chambers by partitions). Beneath the middle room in the southern wing of the gate, \n
the basalt threshold of a Canaanite temple was found. \n
The Canaanite palace: The ruins of the palace are sheltered by a roof, protecting them from wear. The palace was used \n
by the kings of Hatsor in the 14th – 13th centuries BCE. A ritual dais was uncovered in the palace, and at the top of \n
